<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I live in Axvall with my girlfriend Martina. On my freetime I like to sit by my computer and watch movies and series. I also play som computer games aswell. When I'm not at the computer I like to spend time with my family and friends.</p>

<p>Recently I've spent more time outside because we got a dog. It's one of the reasons I wanted to start study remotly, so that I can be home with the dog.</p>

<p>Another reason I started studying webprograming is that I wanted to know more about web development. Earlier I have studied Network and Systemadministration wher I got a some exxperience in C++ and Perl.</p>

<p>After school I've worked as an IT technician and onsite technician. On my freetime I've learnt some programming by myself. I look forward to learn more at BTH.</p>
